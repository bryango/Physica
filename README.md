# Physica
Mathematica utilities for physics, created for personal convenience.

## mamagement
We try to keep the `.wl` scripts readable, both in plaintext and in the Mathematica frontend.
The other files such as `init.m` are not meant for the frontend.

### note
This repository was a fork of `bryango/Templates`, which is now renamed `bryango/texplates` for LaTeX templates only.
